For my final project for the Promineo Tech bootcamp, I built upon my week 15 project (React/CRUD app) by creating an app to help realtors and amateur home designers. The app allows you to create a list of each room and its square footage and the ability to delete each room when renovations are finished. The site also includes a list of websites that may be helpful to its users.

The requirements for this project were to:

- Create a React project using an API of your choice. 
- Use React Router and have at least 3 pages
- Use React Bootstrap (I made a really cool carousel of images of houses that I was proud of making!)
- Contain at least 10 components
- Allow for all CRUD operations
